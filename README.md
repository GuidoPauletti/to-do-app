# to-do-app

I developed this app just with a learning purpose, during the coding sections 
I learned how to make a simple backend using node.js and MySQL. It was also my
first time conecting an API with a front-end.

# front-end

The front-end is build using React Native. 
For the navigation inside the App I used a Stack Navigation style.

# back-end

The back end was made up using node.js and MySQL. 

# compatibility 

This app works for Android, It's not tested for IOS yet.
